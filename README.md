## Application description

* To use the application register on website https://api.openweathermap.org and get personal API key which you can copy-paste on line 34 into variable weather_api_key as a string, and you are ready to check the weather of your desired city LIVE, just type its name and press search
* Idea and building blocks for the app came from Keith Galli's youtube channel (I recommend checking him out, great guy)
* You can chose whether you want to work with json or xml response format from openweather website (I've chosen json)
* There is a lot of data you can extract, but for purposes and simplicity of this app I have chosen 4 (city_name, country, temp, weather_description)
